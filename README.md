## General info
Generating boxes

Generating and displaying on the site one box for each of the objects, using the following rules:

* The id value should be the box id attribute.
* The title value is to be the content of the header.
* The content value is to be inserted after the heir.
* Each of the values in the categories table is to be added as a box class.
It is best to generate the whole box as one text string and then add it to the body or other element.

The classes added on the box:

* highlighted - changes the background color of the whole box,
* special-header - changes the color of the header,
* important - if this class is not present, the box should have opacity: 0.7 ;, and if this class is given, it 
should have opacity: 1 ;
